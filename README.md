This is the GPL source code for Space Trader: Merchant Marine version 1.1.14, released in 2008 by the original developers of the game. The purpose of this repo is to preserve the source code so that it won't be lost to time.

The source code is based on the GPL release of Quake III Arena by id Software, licenced under the GPL (see COPYING.txt for terms of the license).

Even though the source code is licensed under the GPL, the game assets are not and are still under its EULA. Don't ask me to give you the data files, all I will tell you is to buy the game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/11240/Space_Trader_Merchant_Marine/
